## Overview

Slack Integration enables you to send alerts from Intuned to your team's Slack channels. 

## How it works

Intuned offers rich notification functionality, that allows you to configure notifications that can be triggered periodically or when a queries results change. Additionally, you get an option to configure the notification title, body, and recipient. With the Slack integration you can choose a Slack channel as the recipient. So, whenever the configured notification is triggered the channel will be updated with the query results that the team was interested in tracking.

3. Select the "Connect to Slack" button and grant permissions to the Intuned slack application and select a specific channel you are interested in
