## Known limitations

### Correlated sub-queries

Intuned doesn't support correlated sub-queries in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `JOIN` clauses.

### TOP flavors

Intuned ignores `WITH TIES` and evaluates query as regular `TOP`. Intuned doesn't support `PERCENT`.

### Cursors

Intuned doesn't support SQL cursors.

### Flow control

Intuned doesn't support flow control statements, except for a few limited cases, such as `IF` `THEN` `ELSE` clause that has the identical schema for the `THEN` and `ELSE` batches.

### Data types

Depending on the query, the data returned may have a different type than in SQL Server. An obvious example here are types such as `TINYINT` and `SMALLINT` that have no equivalent in Intuned. Therefore, clients that expect a value of type `BYTE` or `INT16` might get an `INT32` or an `INT64` value instead.

### Column order in results

When asterix is used in the `SELECT` statement, the order of columns in each result set may differ in Intuned. Client that use column names would work better in these cases. If there is no asterix character in the `SELECT` statement, the column ordinals would be preserved.

### ANY, ALL, and EXISTS predicates

Intuned doesn't support the predicates `ANY`, `ALL`, and `EXISTS`.

### Recursive CTEs

Intuned doesn't support recursive common table expressions.

### Dynamic SQL

Intuned doesn't support dynamic SQL statements (inline execution of SQL script generated by the query).

### WITHIN GROUP

Intuned doesn't support `WITHIN GROUP` clause.

### TRUNCATE function

TRUNCATE function (ODBC) in Intuned works similarly to ROUND, which means that the result will be the nearest value instead of the lower one returned in SQL.
